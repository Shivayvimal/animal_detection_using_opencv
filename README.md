# Animal Detection in Farms using OpenCV

## Overview
This project uses OpenCV to detect animals in farm environments, providing a solution for monitoring and managing farm activities efficiently. The system leverages computer vision and machine learning models to identify animals in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time animal detection using OpenCV.
- Audio alerts for detected animals.
- Pre-trained models for accurate detection.
- Easy-to-use interface with a step-by-step setup guide.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Animal-Detection-in-Farms-using-OpenCV.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Animal-Detection-in-Farms-using-OpenCV
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the animal detection process.
3. Ensure the required models are in the `models` directory.
